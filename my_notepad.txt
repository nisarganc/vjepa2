Dataset inference on AIR-Tower:

Droid:
    1. export TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH=true
    2. load full episode for inference using droid dataset loader

UTN:
    1. check cem params
    2. plot inference results
    2. compare action cordinates and gripper conventions with droid

Run robot inference on AIR-Tower


1. Fix cam port in run_inference_UTN.py

2. check doid EE coordinates and gripper offset 
    - check if implementation of ee state and gripper state matches with it

3. Fix observation reading in lab from cameras (same pos as droid, resolution, etc)
    - resolution: 256  x 256
    - frame-rate: 4 fps

4. Run pretrained v-jepa-ac action inference until goal_image state is reached
    - closed-loop model-predictive control
